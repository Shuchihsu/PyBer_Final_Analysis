# Ride Analysis with Matplotlib

## Overview of Project

    The ride-sharing business, PyBer, would like to know how they are doing in each city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural). We are using Matplotlib to create all different kinds of chart to show the business. In this project, we are creating a line graph to show the total fare by each city type for each month.

### Results

  There are several major findings we can see from the analysis and graph:
* The total ride counts: the further away from city, the rides are lower. The ride count comparison is: Rural < Suburban < urban.
* The Total drivers: the further away from city, the drivers are less. The driver amount comparison is: Rural < Suburban < urban.
* Total Fare: the rural area has much higher total fare then the suburban and rural.
* Average Fare per Ride: the further away from city, the fare per ride the higher. So, the fare value per ride is: Rural > Suburban > urban.
* Average Dare per Drive: rural has a very high value per drive ($55.49). It is 4.6 times than Urban.

* If we just look at each city type, they all have stable fare value for each month in spring. If we extend our search, we can see if other seasons are doing better and decide when might be the busy season for the ride sharing.

### Summary
 
## The recommendations to CEO

* Rural and urban areas have their own advantages. In the busy city (urban), the destinations are probably closer to each other, so each ride fare is less. But the ride counts are high, means the demand is high. PyBer can recruit more drivers in the urban cities and maybe they will see the total fare will go up.
* The rural area has less drives, but each drive could be longer distances. If there are any good visitor towns, they can try to promote those area and help the drivers to get more long-term or travel-type of drives to increase their fare per drive or the drive count.
* We could put a little more budgets to analyze for last 3 to 5 years data and look for certain peak seasons for each city type. In those peak seasons, we can create a shorten plan to recruit seasonal drivers to increase the total fare.
